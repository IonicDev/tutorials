# Embargo Server

This repository contains two waypoints.  Waypoint 1 is a basic Tomcat Webapp server that uploads
files.  Waypoint 2 is a Tomcat Webpp server that uploads files with an embargo date and time.

## Use case

A use case for an Embargo Server is when a company official wants to load a document or documents, but
desires the document to be seen after a certain date and time.  This includes new product launch
information, mergers and acquistions, and quarterly results statements.

## More Information

Go to each waypoint for prerequisites, building and running the Webapp.

The [Embargo Server Tutorial](https://dev.ionic.com/tutorials/sdk-advanced/embargo-server) walkthroughs
the code to show how to use the Machina Java SDK in the Webapp.
