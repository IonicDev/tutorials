# Machina Tutorials
To run the tutorials in this repository, you need to have a Machina tenant. Obtaining a Machina tenant is done by clicking on *"Start For Free"* on the [Machina Developers Portal](https://ionic.com/developers). After your tenant has been created, you'll be directed to create your device credentials. Depending on the language chosen, you might have to install an SDK.  Once you have run *"Hello, World!"*, you're ready for the tutorials.

This repository is used in conjunction with [Machina Tutorials](https://dev.ionic.com/tutorials) where there are explanations for each tutorial.  A learning order is suggested there.

The tutorials are in C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Tutorials are first organized by
languages and then by complexity.  There are two tutorial levels: sdk-basics, and sdk-advanced.
Not all tutorials are available all languages.
