# Machina Tutorials
To run the tutorials in this repository, you need to have a Machina tenant. Obtaining a Machina tenant is done by clicking on *"Start For Free"* on the Machina Developer Portal (DevPortal). After your tenant has been created, you'll be directed to create your device credentials. Depending on the language chosen, you might have to install an SDK.  Once you have run *"Hello, World!"*, you're ready for the tutorials.

This repository is used in conjunction with [Machina Tutorials](https://dev.ionic.com/tutorials) where there are explanations for each tutorial.  A learning order is suggested there.

The tutorials are in C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and Python. Tutorials are first organized by
languages and then by complexity.  There are two tutorial levels: sdk-basics, and sdk-advanced.
Not all tutorials are in all languages.

* agents - Create and configure an Ionic agent.
* encryption - AES encypt data using Ionic keys.
* ionic-ciphers - Encypt and format data using Ionic-crypto ciphers.
