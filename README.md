This repository is used in conjunction with [Ionic Tutorials](https://dev.ionic.com/tutorials) 
where there are explanations for each tutorial.  A learning order is suggested
there.

The tutorials are in C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and Python. Tutorials are first divided by
langauges and then by complexity, sdk-basics, and sdk-advanced.  Not all tutorials are in

* ionic-ciphers - Encypt and format data using Ionic-crypto ciphers.
* keys - Create, fetch, and update Ionic keys.
* profiles - Load a profile from a persistor and select and active profile.

The sdk-advanced tutorial is:

* raw-crypto-cypher - create a custom cipher using Ionic crypto library. (Only in C++)
