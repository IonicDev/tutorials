This repository is used in conjunction with [Ionic Tutorials](https://dev.ionic.com/tutorials) 
where there are explanations for each tutorial.  A learning order is suggested
there.

The tutorials are in C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and Python. Tutorials are first organized by
languages and then by complexity.  There are two tutorial levels: sdk-basics, and sdk-advanced.
Not all tutorials are in all languages.
